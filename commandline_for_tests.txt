Terminal command line to test code:

>>> TEST_DATA_HOME=$HOME/Desktop/nitransforms-tests python3 -m pytest

Also works for a path to a specific test, eg:

>>> TEST_DATA_HOME=$HOME/Desktop/nitransforms-tests python3 -m pytest ~/workspace/nitransforms/nitransforms/tests/test_base.py::test_TransformBase
